# Go Connections Game

This project is a clone of [New York Times' Connections game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections), implemented in Go using the amazing [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library. It's a fun and engaging text-based game that challenges players to make connections between different items.
